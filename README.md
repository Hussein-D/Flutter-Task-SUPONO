# Flutter Application README

## Overview

This Flutter application is built with a focus on adhering to the SOLID principles and follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The architecture is structured around separating concerns into distinct layers: Domain Layer, Data Layer, and Presentation Layer. Each feature within the application follows this layered architecture, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

## Architecture Overview

### SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles serve as a foundation for clean, maintainable, and scalable code. This application is designed with a strict adherence to these principles, ensuring:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class or module within the application has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, maintain, and test.
  
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The application's components are open for extension but closed for modification, allowing for new features to be added without altering existing code.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes can be substituted for their base types, facilitating code reuse and polymorphic behavior.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces are client-specific, promoting loose coupling and better code maintainability.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but instead depend on abstractions, decoupling modules and making them easier to test and maintain.

### Clean Architecture Layers

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business logic and domain models of the application. This layer is independent of any specific UI framework or external dependencies.

2. **Data Layer**: Responsible for interacting with external data sources such as databases, APIs, or local storage. It abstracts away the details of data retrieval and manipulation from the rest of the application.

3. **Presentation Layer**: Handles the user interface and user interaction logic. This layer is responsible for presenting data to the user and responding to user input.

### State Management

State management in this application is handled using BLoC (Business Logic Component) and Provider. BLoC architecture facilitates separation of concerns by abstracting business logic from the UI layer, while Provider is used for dependency injection and managing state across the application.

## Testing

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is followed rigorously throughout the development process. Each feature within the application has corresponding unit tests, integration tests, and widget tests (the last two to be supported) to ensure functionality and maintainability. Use cases are defined to test each layer independently, promoting code reliability and robustness.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project_directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Run the application: `flutter run`
